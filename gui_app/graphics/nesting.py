"""Material nesting and optimization algorithms - Future Feature.

This module will provide intelligent material nesting to minimize waste
and optimize production efficiency.

Planned Features:
- Automatic part placement on stock material sheets
- Multiple nesting algorithms (greedy, genetic, etc.)
- Consideration of grain direction for wood
- Waste calculation and reporting
- Support for various stock sizes
- Integration with cutting lists
