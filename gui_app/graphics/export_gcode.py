"""G-code generation for CNC manufacturing - Future Feature.

This module will provide CNC G-code generation for automated
cutting, drilling, and routing operations.

Planned Features:
- Generate toolpaths for CNC routers and mills
- Support for multi-axis operations
- Tool change management
- Feed rate and spindle speed optimization
- Safe height and clearance plane handling
