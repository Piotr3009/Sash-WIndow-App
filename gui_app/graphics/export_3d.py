"""3D model export (STL/OBJ format) - Future Feature.

This module will provide 3D model generation and export capabilities
for advanced visualization and manufacturing workflows.

Planned Features:
- Extrude 2D window profiles into 3D solid models
- Export to STL format for 3D printing and visualization
- Export to OBJ format with materials for rendering
- Generate assemblies with proper component hierarchy
- Support for different levels of detail (LOD)
